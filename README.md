# VALOR (Temporary Name)

Valor is a MOBA intended to get me familiar with all major components of Unreal Engine 4. The content of this repository is not meant to be the prettiest or most functional code. This is a playground for me to see how things interact and to allow me to fail early and learn from those mistakes.

This project is currently on hold while the Restless framework is in development.

## While the code is public it is still copyrighted. Please contact me if you wish to use any of the code or assets in this project.
